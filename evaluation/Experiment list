Ideia de como normalizar as datas de log:

19:18:23 , 1200
19:18:24, 1321
A1-$A$1,  1200
A2-$A$1, 1321

Thinking time: 100ms
	CPU Bound
		Sem logger 
			10 threads, 300 commands, 1 kb <- A
			50 threads, 300 commands, 1 kb <- B
			100 threads, 300 commands, 1 kb <- C
			500 threads, 300 commands, 1 kb <- D
		Logger acoplado
